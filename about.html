    &emsp;I started coding as a hoby when I was 13.  My first program was a version of Pong that I put together in 
    QBasic.  I instantly fell in love with it.  I was lucky enough in high school to have programming and 
    networking classes in the curriculum, and continued to develop my passion for IT.  I did not follow the more
    classical trajectory in life, and after high school I skipped college and went straight to work doing on the 
    phone internet support for TDS.

    &emsp;I knew I wanted more out of life though, and at 24 decided to return to school.  I loved IT, but wanted a
    career that gave me the oppurtunity to to contribute towards solutions that addressed the serious issues
    we face as a society on a daily basis.  I pursued a degree in my second passion, biology. After graduating
    I began working as a lab tech in research labs, then moved on to working with clinical research trials.
    Yet despite working in lab positions, I kept getting pulled back into development.  I often listed
    my IT experience on resumes, as it seemed to give me a leg up over other candidates. And the labs I worked in always
    had projects they wanted me to play around with.  Eventually I was hired by a lab at UCSF Medical School and moved
    to Kampala, Uganda and help implement a new clinical reserach trial (PRISM).  This was my first job where developing an 
    application was one of the key expectations.  I had found a way to combine my love of medicine with my passion
    for development.

    &emsp; When I returned to the States I knew I wanted to continue to combine my distinct skill sets. While
    I enjoyed working as a lab tech, I wanted to focus on my development skills and work on building
    applications that aided the medical communicty. The Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention proved
    to be a great place to hone these skills. I was hired in a data management capacity, but was told part of
    the job would be developing an Access application to help manage this process. After developing the data 
    management application I began working with the centers DBA and was brought in on new projects.  
    I took coursera classes on python and java, and finally decided to go back to UW Madison to pursue a 
    CS certificate.

    &emsp; As my skills have developed, so has my love for building medical applications. I am dedicated to developing
    software that can be used to improve and contribute to the medical process. And whether it entails 
    helping clincal trials run more effeciently, with better results like I am doing now, developing 
    tools to help solve medical questions, or bulding medical systems that modernize our approaches to 
    patient care, I know I will find a career that is both rewarding and challenging while combining 
    two fields that I have fallen in love with.
