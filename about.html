    &emsp;Back in eight grade I stumbled accross QBasic while poking around in Windows 95. It was winter break, and I
    had a few weeks to kill. I was blindly clicking my way through file trees trying to peice together how
    everything worked when I ran accross it. I tracked it down online and began reading up on it. It sounded intersting so
    I started to play around with it. I remember working my way though a list of commands, and when I found one that seemed
    to make sense I would pull it into he compiler and start messing around with it.  I would add new flags, or mess around
    with different paremeters, while trying to figure out how everything fit together. I was feeling confident as I started 
    to string the code together, only to hit a roadblock.  I remember the frustration of spending hours, first trying to 
    find a solution to the problem, then trying to figure out a new approach.  
    
<p>
    I was enthralled. Not just by the development, but by the process. Finding something new and learning more about it, 
    then my kinisthetic nature taking over as I start to play around with it. Gaining confidence only to hit a road
    block, then feeling overwhelmed, buried in frustration, as I try to find a soltuion. Yet in that frustration finding
    an exuberance as I start pouring through documentation. Every question asked yeilding only more questions, but as I work
    my way through them a system begins to emerge. And in that system a solution, or a realization that there is a better, or 
    at least different, approach you can take. And in finding a soltion, also finding satisfaction. Not just in the solution, but
    in the realization that in solving it I had learned more about how the tool worked than I had in days of playing around
    with the parts that failed to give me any issues.


     not just from solving the
    road block, but also in realizing 
    that in solving the road block you
    learned more about the system trying to solve this one problem, then you did 


    I found I enjoyed each phase of the process as it
    unfolded while learning that first language. 

    
    Starting to dig around
    as my inquisative nature takes over and just as I am feeling like its making sense, hitting a road block. Feeling 
    overwhelmed when you hit a road block. Hours, even days spent trying to find a solution, pouring through every resource
    you can find to find an answer.  



    &emsp;I started coding as a hoby when I was 13.  My first program was a version of Pong that I put together in 
    QBasic.  I instantly fell in love with it.  I was lucky enough in high school to have programming and 
    networking classes in the curriculum, and continued to develop my passion for IT.  I did not follow the more
    classical trajectory in life, and after high school I skipped college and went straight to work doing on the 
    phone internet support for TDS.

    &emsp;I knew I wanted more out of life though, and at 24 decided to return to school.  I loved IT, but wanted a
    career that gave me the oppurtunity to to contribute towards solutions that addressed the serious issues
    we face as a society on a daily basis.  I pursued a degree in my second passion, biology. After graduating
    I began working as a lab tech in research labs, then moved on to working with clinical research trials.
    Yet despite working in lab positions, I kept getting pulled back into development.  I often listed
    my IT experience on resumes, as it seemed to give me a leg up over other candidates. And the labs I worked in always
    had projects they wanted me to play around with.  Eventually I was hired by a lab at UCSF Medical School and moved
    to Kampala, Uganda and help implement a new clinical reserach trial (PRISM).  This was my first job where developing an 
    application was one of the key expectations.  I had found a way to combine my love of medicine with my passion
    for development.

<p>
    &emsp; When I returned to the States I knew I wanted to continue to combine my distinct skill sets. While
    I enjoyed working as a lab tech, I wanted to focus on my development skills and work on building
    applications that aided the medical communicty. The Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention proved
    to be a great place to hone these skills. I was hired in a data management capacity, but was told part of
    the job would be developing an Access application to help manage this process. After developing the data 
    management application I began working with the centers DBA and was brought in on new projects.  
    I took coursera classes on python and java, and finally decided to go back to UW Madison to pursue a 
    CS certificate.

<p>
    &emsp; As my skills have developed, so has my love for building medical applications. I am dedicated to developing
    software that can be used to improve and contribute to the medical process. And whether it entails 
    helping clincal trials run more effeciently, with better results like I am doing now, developing 
    tools to help solve medical questions, or bulding medical systems that modernize our approaches to 
    patient care, I know I will find a career that is both rewarding and challenging while combining 
    two fields that I have fallen in love with.
