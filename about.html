    &emsp;Back in eight grade I stumbled accross QBasic while poking around in Windows 95. It was winter break, and I
    had a few weeks to kill. I was blindly clicking my way through file trees trying to peice together how
    everything worked when I ran accross it. Curious, I poured through the help files, 
    and slowly began peicing parts together. Road blocks came up along the way, puzzles to solve, I found myself
    frustrated at times and felt like giving up. But piecing together a solution bit by bit, and channeling that frustartion
    into productivitiy and problem solving,  within a couple of weeks I had put together my first program - Pong. 
    Sure, it was lacking in features, and the ball was just a 'x' floating its way accross the screen.  But you better
    believe that that x moved faster the further you made it, and I remember being proud of getting it to work.
</p> 
<p>
        &emsp;I was enthralled. Not just by the development, but by the process. Finding something new and learning more about it.
    My kinisthetic nature takes over as I start to play around with it. Gaining confidence only to hit a road
    block, then feeling overwhelmed, buried in frustration, as I try to find a soltuion. Yet in that frustration finding
    an exuberance as I start pouring through documentation. Every question asked yeilding only more questions, but as I work
    my way through them a system begins to emerge. In that system a solution, and in finding a soltion, also finding 
    satisfaction. Not just in the solution, but in the realization that in solving it I had learned more about how the tool 
    worked in hours or days than I had in the weeks preceeding when everything had just fit together. To this day I still find 
    this my favorit part of the learning process, despite never being willing to admit it at the time. 
</p>
<p>
        &emsp;The process repeats over again, a new level of understanding as I tackle larger problems. Thinking I know it all only 
    to dig a little deaper. Realizing I had only scratched the surface.  My code works, but how could I make it work 
    better? Could I do it with less code? Could I make it run faster? There were a few bugs, how do I catch them faster?
    I push it out, people are loving it, im awesome.  But changes post production lead to headaches.  I had to restructure
    to implement them. People wernt happy about turn around time. How could my code be more maluable?  Develop a more modulare 
    approach leading to more effecient and reusable code. I am great at this.  Lets look at other peoples code, oh lord, I
    have no idea how this even works. The process repeats over again. 
</p>
<p>
        &emsp;The development! A blank canvas.  The tools learned, ready to use. As I hear the project explaned
    a solution begans to emerge.  Scaffoliding built peice by peice as I mock up the desired components in my head.
    I become a composer. The orchestration of each peice required as I work my way through the problem. Thinking about the 
    right tools as I sketch out the tables and data structures.  Building the foundation as I peice together the architecture.
    The blurry lines become more defined as fragments began fitting together.  Time to go.  But maybe one more hour.
    Driven to build, my code proliforates, systems are working together as I pull each peice from the image in my head. 
<p>
        &emsp;Build, fail, test, try again.  Maybe if I do it this way?  Its working. Build, test, pass, take the next peice. It all starts 
    comming together. I push out a solution. User input leads to changes. Change, build, test, take another piece. Its ready 
    for production.  They love it.  A change here and there, some minor tweaks, make sure it keeps running. The next project is
    comming, how could I have done this one better?

        &emsp;Its not <i> just </i> programming.  I love to learn. Although it may have been hard to convince some people when I was
    19.  HSED in hand and burnt out on school I was ready to make some money. I put my years of tinkering around with computers 
    to good use and started working the phones, providing help desk support for a local ISP.  It was fun for awhile, but I 
    found myself loosing enjoyment in it and I knew I wanted to do more. The world can be large and complicated. We face 
    involved challenges. But I knew that if I could peice together a little corner of it,  I could find a tangeable problem, 
    and at least try to develop a real solution. And I knew that if I could push myself to do this, I would find more than just
    a job, I would find a career that I could be proud off. But at the time, I didn't think I could do it in IT. So at 21 I went 
    back to school.  Working part time, and going to school part time, I picked my way through math and physics, interwoven with
    philosophy and art, at a local technical school. 
</p>
<p>
        &emsp;I was getting ready to trasnfer to UW.  More options, and more challenging classes. But I was still struggeling to choose 
    a path. I was good at physics, but it never really pulled me in. I liked philosophy, but wanted something more hands on.
    Exploring new options my final semester, I landed in a microbiology class.  We learned about the structures and differences
    of microbes in class, then in lab got to swab samples and incubate them on agars so they would grow.  I thought it was so cool.
    It was hands on, yet academic.  And I was amazed at the complexity and in the beauty in how it well the complexity worked 
    together. The ability to mutate and grow, to adapt and change.  I couldnt get enough. 
</p>
<p>
        &emsp;By the end of my sophmore year I had buried myself in cellular biology. It still to this day leaves me in awe as I think about the amazing engeneering we are built upon. So much complxity solved
    with so much amazing simplicity.  But the simplicity entertwined again in the complexity of the larger system that binds
    each peice and each layer together. Trillions of cells with identitcal code, that through a complex series of chemical 
    reactions within cells, and hormanal interactions between them, are able to differentiate into different groups of components
    that change thier internal structures to build even larger groups of organs that then work together to keep all of the groups
    , and as a result the cells, alive. All guided by a complex circuit that is able to rewire itself as it receives 
    electric feeddback from various sensors, and internal feedback through hormonal interactions. A circuit the is able to 
    conceptualize itself.  To change itself through this understanding, to make itself work better.
</p>
<p>
        &emsp;Life is amazing. I found many of the same things I loved in programming in biology.  The complex systems.  The thirll of 
    peicing it all together.  And I found I enjoyed the hands on aspect of it.  Lab work was fun.  It was another set of tools
    that helped solve the problem, but you got to get your hands dirty while you did it.  But I wasn't sure if graduate school
    was right for me at the time.  I liked it, I liked learning about it, and I liked the lab work, but I saw people spending
    a decade focused on one system.  One part.  A mutation in a cell that altered a protein that altered a phenotype. Their 
    little corner, thier contribution.  And I got it.  I got how they could love that, be enthralled by it. But the scope 
    seemed to small.
</p>
<p>
        &emsp;My final year of college I was working in micro lab making growth medium for the researchers, along with other
    student worthy tasks. My final semester they brough in a candidate that was running some bioinformatics project. Some grid
    that ran thousands of assays at once allowing for minisqual changes in a condition, which could then be read in and 
    analyzed. And as part of that he had to develop algorithms to interperet the data, but it meant a project that could have
    taken months could be done in hours.  Neat tool, I thought.

        &emsp;I found myself working as a lab tech, and loving it, for a brief few months when an amazing opurtunity came along.
        It was quite serendipidous in fact. It took a few months to get the lab job, and in the process I had sent in <i>a lot</i> 
        of applications.  When I first started applying I had looked for some oppurtunities overseas.  I spent the summer between my 
        junior and senior year at UW in Tanazania and Kenya doing a curtailed semeseter abraod. It was a large game ecology credit, 
        so we spent class time learning about local wildlife from our tent city on top of the great rift valley, overlooking
        Lake Manyara worked our way through the national. And then we would go on safari through the national parks, identifying 
        species, running counts, and being tourists. This all cummulated with a week camping <i> on </i> the serengetti, surrounded
        by hyenas, running away from water buffalo, and fighing of angry baboons launching an attack party for our breakfast. 
</p>
<p>
        &emsp;I Could hardly find anything, and what I did either didn't want to pay you, or wanted graduate degrees.  So I focused
        my energy back on the states and started applying for jobs around madison, as well as my as in San Fransisco, having spent
        the first 10 years of my life there. When the lab position at AVRL came a long I figured that was a good fit and went on my 
        merry way. But 3 months in I get a call from a lab at UCSF Medical.  They had a lot of applications, but the thought I would
        be a good fit.  They were running analysis on samples they would be collecting from a new project, and saw I had some experience
        with it from my student lab position.  But they needed someone who understood IT to help with sample tracking. At the same time
        rummors were flying that AVRL was thinking about moving to Miami (they eventually did).  So I figured why not, and set up
        and interview.  
    <p>
            &emsp;It came out that the project they were doing was a clinical research project consisting of epedimilogical
        samples, and blood collection from multiple remote sites in Uganad.  I mentioned my time in east Africa, and at the
        end of the interview he mentioned that they actually had been looking for a second candidate to move to Uganda, to 
        help launch the project, and implement a sample tracking database.  He thought I would be perfect.  I thought it 
        sounded amazing. Two more interviews, and two months later I was wheels up and headed over seas. 
    </p>
    <p>
            &emsp;The job was tough.  A new culture, a new contitnent, a totally new world. Working overseas, in the capitol
            city of Kampala, surrounded by 3 million other people, is a very different experience than touring the bush with
            professors and staff to navigate through it for you. 
    </p>
    <p>
            &emsp;I had to develop and application for the lab in Kampala that could track the tens of thousands of samples 
            we would be collecting in the remote village, and allow us to find them when we needed to pull specific samples for 
            shipping back to UCSF. We needed a second system we could send to the remote villages to organize visits and log 
            samples into data as they were collected. But it had to be able to send the data back sans internet due to 
            exactly how remote these villages were.  They wanted it in Access, which was great because I had already been 
            playing around with it for fun. In the end I was able to bring together both the lab, and the system, in time
            for the launch. I found the work incredibly rewarding.  I wasn't just building an application, I was building a process.
            A new way for this lab to run a study.  They had been having issues with tracking samples on other projects, loosing
            key data and flushing assay results. This system solved the problem.  It allowed them to run thier research more
            effeciently, and it gave me a way to contribute towards helping them solve a complex medical problem.  
    </p>
    <p>
            &emsp;I asked a grauduat student back in college what they key to success in research was, and he told me it was in finding
            your niche. It stuck with me. I loved the process in programming, and the results in research. I loved the oppurtunities
            to learn new systems, and solve new problems with skills I enjoyed putting into action. I came back to the states and 
            found a perfect fit at CTRI.  Translational clinical research, looking not just at the science, but working directly
            with the health care providers and EHR developers to implement new solutions.  They wanted someone, who understood data,
            to clean and manipulate datases for analysits. And they wanted them to develop an application in Access (supprisingly the 
            system of choice for the centers full time developer) to help track the data dictionaries for the hundreds of datasets
            they where starting to generate from each study. What luck.
    </p> 
    <p>
            &emsp; I was given an amazing amount of leway to do my job.  And after showing them I could do the data work, then
            putting together what would lovingly come to be refered to as 'the Datanets' (not my name), I was given the freedome 
            to explore my own projects while I did it. I expanded my app, automating aspects of my reoccuring tasks, and started to 
            work with other staff to redevelop the data operations infrastructure, while keeping up with my daily responsibilites. 
            We began to build solutions for some of the defeciences we had found in The Datanets, 
            letting it take over file organization post collection, having it help track PHI, and utilizing API to build surveys
            internally, but export them directly to an external survey tool we used. I began to realize how much developing 
            applications was also about building a new approach, a new system that changes how the problem is approached. 
    </p>
    <p>
            &emsp;I Began working with the centers developer. Almost every new grant and the associated project needed an application
            to help manage the large scale projects.  The center was running a multifactorial design, looking at 16, up to 64
            different conditions and running tens of visits for thousands of pariticpants over a series of years. The application
            managed the project flow, tracked visit data and biometrics, and linked to the correct survey in our online survey tool, 
            that the participants could then walk through. It also managed communication with participants, setting up reminder calls,
            managing over the phone surveys, and many other survey specific communications via a daily call list. It was a great 
            approach to a complex problem that allowed the center to run trials on a scale few other research labs could manage.
    </p>
    <p>
            &emsp;The developer brought me on, first with small solo projects he would watch over, then working directly with him
            on a new itteration of a large grant database. At the same time I began to see that I needed new tools.  Access could
            do far more than people give it credit for, and was a great way to learn how to bring together different tools into a
            working solution.  But as our projects got larger, I knew we were eventually going to need new tools to work with. 
    </p>
    <p>
            &emsp;I found a couple of classes on coursera, and played around with Java and Python. But I knew I needed a better
            understanding than what I would find online.  With my works backing, I enrolled in a CS Capston Certificate at UW 
            Madison. I wanted to learn the fundementals to putting together better software. Again I found myself, years in, 
            realizing how little I still new.

    &emsp;I started coding as a hoby when I was 13.  My first program was a version of Pong that I put together in 
    QBasic.  I instantly fell in love with it.  I was lucky enough in high school to have programming and 
    networking classes in the curriculum, and continued to develop my passion for IT.  I did not follow the more
    classical trajectory in life, and after high school I skipped college and went straight to work doing on the 
    phone internet support for TDS. 
</p>
<p>
    &emsp;I knew I wanted more out of life though, and at 24 decided to return to school.  I loved IT, but wanted a
    career that gave me the oppurtunity to to contribute towards solutions that addressed the serious issues
    we face as a society on a daily basis.  I pursued a degree in my second passion, biology. After graduating
    I began working as a lab tech in research labs, then moved on to working with clinical research trials.
    Yet despite working in lab positions, I kept getting pulled back into development.  I often listed
    my IT experience on resumes, as it seemed to give me a leg up over other candidates. And the labs I worked in always
    had projects they wanted me to play around with.  Eventually I was hired by a lab at UCSF Medical School and moved
    to Kampala, Uganda and help implement a new clinical reserach trial (PRISM).  This was my first job where developing an 
    application was one of the key expectations.  I had found a way to combine my love of medicine with my passion
    for development.  
</p>
<p>
    &emsp; When I returned to the States I knew I wanted to continue to combine my distinct skill sets. While
    I enjoyed working as a lab tech, I wanted to focus on my development skills and work on building
    applications that aided the medical communicty. The Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention proved
    to be a great place to hone these skills. I was hired in a data management capacity, but was told part of
    the job would be developing an Access application to help manage this process. After developing the data 
    management application I began working with the centers DBA and was brought in on new projects.  
    I took coursera classes on python and java, and finally decided to go back to UW Madison to pursue a 
    CS certificate.  
</p>
<p>
    &emsp; As my skills have developed, so has my love for building medical applications. I am dedicated to developing
    software that can be used to improve and contribute to the medical process. And whether it entails 
    helping clincal trials run more effeciently, with better results like I am doing now, developing 
    tools to help solve medical questions, or bulding medical systems that modernize our approaches to 
    patient care, I know I will find a career that is both rewarding and challenging while combining 
    two fields that I have fallen in love with.  
</p>
