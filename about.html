        &emsp;Back in eighth grade I stumbled across QBasic while poking around in Windows 95. I was blindly
    clicking my way through file trees trying to piece together how everything worked when I ran across it.
    Curious, I poured through the help files and slowly began piecing parts together. Road blocks came up
    along the way, puzzles to solve, I found myself frustrated at times and felt like giving up. But by bringing
    together a solution bit by bit, and channeling that frustration into productivity and problem solving,
    within a couple of weeks I had put together my first application - Pong. Sure, it was lacking in features
    and the ball was just an 'O' floating its way across the screen. But you better believe that that O moved
    faster the longer the ball was in play, and I remember being proud of making it work.

<p>
        &emsp; I was enthralled. In programming I saw opportunity.
    I enjoy the challenge of it. A puzzle to solve and a blank canvas to work with. The tools
    learned, ready to use. I become a composer orchestrating each aspect as I work my way through the
    problem. Thinking about the right tools as I sketch out the tables and data structures. Building the
    foundation as I piece together the architecture. The blurry lines become more defined as fragments
    began fitting together, and finally a solution emerges. What fun.
</p> 
<p>
    &emsp;It’s not just programming. I love to learn. In college, unsure what direction I wanted to go in,
    I stumbled into a microbiology class. I was amazed at the complexity and
    beauty in how it all worked together. The ability to mutate and grow, to adapt and change. Still to this
    day it leaves me in awe as I think about the amazing engineering life is built upon. So much complexity
    solved with so much amazing simplicity. But the simplicity intertwined again in the complexity of the
    larger system that binds each piece and each layer together. Life is amazing. I found many of the same
    things I loved in programming in biology. The complex systems. The thrill of piecing it all together. My
    path was set.

    &emsp; After graduating with a Bachelors in Biology I was presented with an amazing opportunity. I
    received a call from a lab at UCSF Medical. They were doing a clinical research project collecting blood
    and epidemiological samples from remote sites in Uganda. They needed someone in San Francisco to
    run analysis on samples they would be collecting, and saw I had experience with their assays. I
    mentioned having spent a summer in East Africa, and at the end of the interview he informed me that 
    they had been looking for a second candidate to move to Uganda, both to help launch the project and
    then also to implement a sample tracking database. He thought I would be perfect. Two months later I
    was wheels up and headed overseas.
</p> 
<p>
    &emsp;The database I developed had to track the tens of thousands of samples we would be collecting,
    which would then allow us to pull specific samples as needed for shipping back to UCSF. I found the
    work incredibly rewarding. I wasn't just building an application, I was building a process. A new way for
    this lab to run a study. They had been having issues with tracking samples on other projects, losing key
    data and having to flush assays as a result. The system I built solved the problem, allowing them to run
    their research more efficiently and with less waste.

    &emsp;I came back to the states and found a new opportunity to contribute at The Center for Tobacco
    Research and Intervention (CTRI). Not only does the center run clinical effectiveness trials, but they work
    directly with health care systems and EPIC to implement better clinical solutions for tobacco cessation.
    My initial responsibilities involved cleaning and manipulating large datasets for analysis, as well
    as developing an app to help track the data dictionaries for the hundreds of datasets they were starting
    to generate from each study.
</p> 
<p>
    &emsp; As my tenure progressed I began helping build the applications the center developed to manage the each of
    the centers large scale projects. The center was running multifactorial designs with numerous visits for thousands of participants over
    multiple of years. The applications managed the project flow and walked health councilors through each
    participant’s condition specific protocols. It was a great approach to a complex problem that allowed the
    center to run projects on a scope many other labs could not manage.
</p> 
<p>
    &emsp; In college I asked a graduate student what he thought was the key to success in research. He
    told me it was in finding your niche. It stuck with me. I love the work I have done both in Uganda and with CTRI.
    It has given me the opportunity to bring together two fields I was passionate about. It provided a chance to use technology
    to improve the medical process. I know I had found my niche. My passion for medicine and my enjoyment in CS provide me with 
    a beneficial way to contribute. I am currently working towards a Master in Computer Science, so that I can continue to 
    develop tools that enrich and improve medical and scientific infrastructure.
