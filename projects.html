            <p><b>Overview</b></p>
            <p> 
                One of the firsts tasks I was asked to perform on arrivale at CTRI was to develop an access application 
                that could track data dictionaries for datasets associated with the center.  The center runs numerous 
                concurrent studies ranging from tracking 20-30 participants over a couple of months up to tracking
                thousands of participants over the series of 1-3 years.  Studies could produce hundreds of raw datasets from
                many different sources, and the previous system of tracking via excel was getting out of hand. In addition
                to adding datasets, I added the ability to track the 'lineage' of datasets and variables. This allowed us
                to follow the progression of raw data through the cleaning process and into large analysis sets.
            </p>       
            <p>
                In my data management role it quickly became apparent that the center was running into issues with 
                consistancy among assesments.  Even within the same project an assessment with multiple time points asked
                the same question differently, both in terms of phrasing, and code book responses. It quickly became apparent
                that my application could do more to help the center.
            </p>
            <p>
                By linking the variables in the dataset to a unique list of variables (which we called 'meta' variabels), I 
                was able to add functionality to compare like variables against each other.  This was so successful that we moved
                the development of Qualtrics assesments into the Datanets, and added in the ability to export the created assessments
                into files that could be imported directly into Qualtrics.  This significantly improved consistancy, cut down on 
                transcription errors, and sped up project development. This also turned the Datanets into a multi-user project, with
                project management and the Qualtrics team as added users.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of our data cleaning and manipulation is handled through SPSS syntax.  This gives us an easy to follow
                (and justify) trail of how our data was processed. But developing syntax can be tedious and time consuming.
                Given that all of the data was already being tracked in the Datanets, the next logical step was to get the 
                datanets to automate significant aspects of the syntax development.  Initially this was doen through a simple
                form allowing me to select variables and run different operations to generate syntax (keep statements, recodes,
                value and variable labels, etc).  I then moved into creating SPSS syntax templates that could be manipulated
                in one easy step to generate the bulk of both the cleaning syntax, and the syntax necessary to generate merged
                analysis sets.  This greatly reduced the turn around time in the data management process, getting PIs qaulity 
                data faster. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additional tools were added that allowed access to interface with SPSS via python scripts.  These tools included
                validating the variables in the Datanets matched the variables in the dataset, running syntax directly from the 
                Datanets, and importing data dictionaries directly from SPSS data files.
            </p>
            <p>
                The datanets quickly grew into the largest solo project I have ever produced.  It contains **stats** and provides
                tools in the following ares
                **tools**

            <p><b>Overview</b></p>
            <p>
                The majority of the grade in SE centers around a group project.  The group I ended up in was tasked with
                creating a web page to help with volunteer management for a Humane Society website.  This was not only my
                first foray into web development, but the entire groups.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Having already had significant experience with app development, I was voted in as group leader.  This 
                provided a great oppurtunity not just to learn web development, but to learn how to manage a project with
                a large number of developers (the group had 9 members, myself included)

            <p><b>Overview</b></p>
            <p>
                Almost every clinical trial run at CTRI is accompanied by a project database. The databases, initially developed by
                our former DBA Paul Kohn, handles particpant screening, scheduling, daily call lists, appointment flowsheets (which 
                vary by condition and visit), assessments, payments, and reporting. Each project pulled components from prior project 
                DBs, but had to be modified to meet specific project requirements.
            </p>    
            <p>
                Prior to Pauls departure I was brought in to help with the development of the QUITS database, and after he left I was
                tasked with developing the new Disparities project.  Most of the work involved pulling components from multiple
                previous applications, and refactoring the code to get it all working together. One issue with previous projects was a 
                detached and clutered UI.  As part of this project I took the oppurtunity to clean up the  interface, improving usability
                and creating a cohesive application.
            </p>
            <p>
                One contribution I provided to QUITs and carried over to Disparities was the redevelopment of the 'Find A Person' form.
                The old form involved the development of multiple queries that were swapped out as search fields were changed.  This 
                approach, used throughout the project databases, was effecient under heavy load or for users with poor connectivity, but 
                having numerous queries involved in one form made modification a much more arduose process.  An alternative approach, 
                using immediate if statements, allows for quick modification, but slows down significantly under heavy use. To overcome 
                both of these issues I built a class that binds form fields directly to a base query and dynamically builds and modifies
                the query as search parameters change.  The bound fields can be used for either searching or sorting the associated 
                dataset. This approach has the added benefit of allowing for the dynamic and live swap of fields in the query and thier 
                bindings.  Drop downs on the Find A Person form, for example, allow you to swap between study status, email, and phone 
                number, using the same two buttons for searching and sorting depending on what is selected.  This made for quick loads, 
                easy modification, and fitting more fields in a limmited space. The easy initialization and binding allowed the class
                to be utilized as a template and implemented on other forms carrying out similar functionality.

            <p><b>Overview</b></p>
            <p>
                When I was brought on to help out with the QUITs project at CTRI, the first task I was assigned
                was to implement the IVR system.  The first aspect of this was to develop the IVR calls themselves
                in Aspect.  The second part was to take the P01 IVR call manager application (MS Access) and make 
                it work with QUITs. This included developing a second aspect to the manager that could contact 
                participants via an emailed survey link, so they could do the survey online instead of over the 
                phone.  Like the calls, the emails had to be sent out at the correct times, and record that the 
                contact had occured.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the call managers themselves were fairly stable, the overall system was plagued with errors.
                This was amplified over the summer of 2018 as we had significant construction occuring outside our
                building. VoIP boxes would fail, we struggled with phone lines going dead, power outages would occur
                and servers would not load properly (call manager or web servers would not reload), or calls would fail
                simply because we ran out of ports.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the time we had 3 seperate call managers (QUITS, BAVA, P01) running.  This lead to the system
                requiring heavy monitoring in multiple different projects, and even then we would not always find
                out about issues until particpants started reporting issues the next day (or even days) after the 
                start of the outage
            </p>
            <p>
                To combate this I suggested we build a couple of applications.  One that allowed us to monitor all of
                our projects IVR systems from one application, and a second service that would piggy back off this app
                and constantly monitor our IVR systems for failures, then send text warning message to myself and other
                staff if anything went down.
            </p>
            <p>
                As my development skills have progressed I have strived towards writing more effecient code. In Access 
                this included writting classes like the Query Builder in Disparities, and developing template forms 
                like Find A Person that can be easily repurposed for new views that required dynamic query modification.
                As I moved into OOP languages I started thinking more about project architecture. I had been pushing CTRI
                to move towards center wide development goals, instead of developing apps on a project by project basis.
                Aspects of the project database, such as the Health Councelors availability, reporting, and the IVR call
                managers could all be handled by one app, decreasing what needed to be reworked for each new project. To 
                prove that this was a realistic approach, I was set on making this monitoring app work not just on our 
                current projects, but to be easily adaptable to future projects as well.    
            </p>
            <p> 
                To accomplish this I decoupled the application into smaller components, including a Data Access Layer for
                each of the projects it would serve, a parent application with its own DB, including constants, and the
                informmation about the DALs, the monitoring application, and the monitoring service.  This took a little
                more work up front, but meant that new projects could be added in simply by creating the DAL and adding it
                to the list in the parent DB.  This also meant that most of the code for the DAL could be placed in the
                parent class and only written once, and the app and service did not need to know what they were working on,
                they just needed to perform their tasks
            </p>
            <p>
                This project helped us immediatly identify outages, and visually monitor the managers for any potential
                issues not caught by the service.

                LastFM was the final project for my RDBMs class.  While not a very large project, it did
                provide the oppurtunity to work Azure.  This was my first exposure to cloud based data
                storage.  It also provided me with more exposure to dotnet, and another chance to play around
                with data visualization.

            <p> While not a very large project, it does prove that I have written code in Java. This was also
                my first exposure to form development outside of MS Access.  I enjoy java, but found that c#
                has identical syntext, better libraries for data access, and dotnet contains easy to use form 
                builders that I found easier to work with than Scene Builder.

                The address book was the first project I was asked to work on by CTRIs former DBA.  The project
                was initially developed even before his time there and had some significant issues with the back
                end design.  This was my first exposure to working with a MS SQL back end, and the first time 
                reworking someone elses code.  In the end I overhauled aspects of the backend (including splitting
                existing tables into more normalized forms), and completely redesigned the front end.

            <p>
                Working for IDRC in Uganda was an amazing oppurtunity, but provided some unique chalenges.
                I was brought in to help launch the lab aspects of a new clinical research trial focusing
                on Malaria. Part of my responsibilities included setting up a series of applications. One
                that could be used in very remote villages with no internet access to track participant 
                blood sample collection, and a second application to be used in Kampala, to recieve the data
                from our three remote sites, run QC on the data and samples, track all samples in Kampala,
                and allow us to pull said samples for shipment to UCSF Medical in California.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was a challenging process and my first full professional application.  We generated
                barcodes then used tablets and barcode scanners to collect samples at the remote sites. An
                export function allowed us to push the data to a thumb drive that was shipped with the samples.
                In the main lab we pulled the data off the thumbdrive, which instigated the QC and local tracking
                processes. Overall we ended up collecting and tracking over 50,000 samples.
